**About**

This is a tagcloud plugin for the Croogo CMS 1.3 and more recent versions. You can choose the desired ID of the vocabularies that you want to be displayed, the amount of these specific "tags" and - if you like to - you can have them all shuffled.

**Installation**

In order to install just grab this package. You can either install it via the plugin manager, or you unzip the package, rename the folder to "tagcloud" and put it into the plugin directory of your croogo installation.
